## Summary/TLDR

Do this at your own risk. I am not an expert. If something goes wrong use
Safe-Mode and the CRU reset script to fix it, etc.

First, confirm your timeout has a similar cause to mine. You can do this by
checking your VRAM frequency. If the VRAM frequency is constantly at max, then
you might have the same or similar issue. This frequency should be able to
drop to a few hundred MHz when the PC is idle, but mine was locked at 1750MHz
which is the default max VRAM speed for my 5600 XT GPU. Remember to close all
other programs when checking this value using [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/gpu-z/)
or the Radeon Software Metrics, as shown.

There are two straightforward solutions to this problem. The easiest option is
to change your refresh rate to 120Hz in the Advanced display settings of
Windows, but that kinda sucks especially you've payed for 24Hz more that
your conscious mind can barely perceive ðŸ˜‰

<table style="text-align: center;margin: auto;padding: 1.5em 1em;">

    <tr>
      <th style="padding: 0 1em;">Refresh Rate</th>
      <th style="padding: 0 1em;">Frametime</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>144Hz</td>
      <td>6.944ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>120Hz</td>
      <td>8.333ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>60Hz</td>
      <td>16.666ms</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If you really want 144/165Hz then you need to correct your high refresh rate to
use correct/standard VESA timings with CRU (Custom Resolution Utility) like
so:

1. Download [CRU](https://www.techspot.com/downloads/7345-custom-resolution-utility.html) and unzip it.
1. Start the CRU program by double-clicking the blue icon.
1. Double-click your 144/165Hz resolution from the *Detailed resolutions* list.
1. Change the *Timing* setting from **Manual** to **Automatic (PC)**. Don't change anything else.

    ![CRU Automatic Timing](/res/img/posts/2021-07-26-amd-driver-memory-lock-timeout/summary-cru-automatic-pc.png)
1. Click OK to save the new timing values.
1. Close CRU by clicking OK.
1. Run the *restart64* script included with CRU.
1. Wait for your monitor to refresh.

Your VRAM frequency should now be idling at a lower value than it was prior
to adjusting the timing using CRU. You can see that my 5600 XT VRAM idles at
200MHz after applying this fix.

Using the automatic CRU timings at 144Hz supports 8-bit colour on my monitor.
The highest refresh rate I can obtain with 10-bit colour via CRU is 138Hz.
I also found that I could leave all timing settings in CRU at the defaults and
simply increase the Vertical Blank from the default value. Increasing it from
the default of 56 to 98 works for me, but the exact values will probably vary
across monitors.

That's all folks, no need to read beyond here unless you're bored and want some
background information!

## The Issue

Does the following image make your blood boil? It sure as shit had an
affect on me this past year. The idea that your GPU might be toast sucks, but
it's a complete nightmare in the current PC hardware market. Thankfully, for
some of us, it's just a software issue related to our GPU and monitor not
playing nice!

For some people this dialog isn't displayed, but they get a warning in their
Windows logs that states "driver amdkmdag stopped responding and has
successfully recovered".

![AMD Driver Timeout Dialog](https://i.imgur.com/vMw4VvX.png)

There are many potential causes for this issue. Poor RAM compatibility,
unstable RAM timings, unstable overclock, and a weak PSU seem to be common
causes. In my case it appears to be a specific AMD Driver issue due to my GPU
and 144Hz monitor combination.

I'm the owner of an MSI *Radeon RX 5600 XT GAMING X*. It's a fantastic
GPU for the price, considering it gives an [RTX 2060 **Super** a run for it's money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKh-z-tLUxQ), assuming you can find one at MSRP these days. Its cooler is
an [absolute unit](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/absolute-unit), so it has a
nice feature that allows it to disable the fans when not gaming. Unfortunately
the AMD drivers combined with my monitor have a *bit* of an issue when gaming
at 1440p 144Hz in Windows; the driver crashes occasionally. And yes, based on
my limited testing, Fedora Linux 34 does not suffer from this issue when gaming
at 1440p 144Hz.

This GPU had a [bit of rough a launch](https://www.techspot.com/news/85113-amd-recommends-radeon-rx-5600-xt-owners-update.html),
so I cut it some slack when this issue started occurring. After multiple driver
updates I started to lose hope though. The awful state of the GPU market made
matters even worse. Returning it would result in credit/cash towards a
new massively overpriced GPU. Worse again, I bought it from the UK so I wasn't
sure how the Brexit shenanigans might affect the return process. Another matter
of concern is that this appears to be a software issue when using certain
monitors and refresh rates, so the return would probably have been rejected!

After trying ~~almost~~ literally every fix posted online, I eventually
found that I could fix the problem by lowering my refresh rate to 120Hz. I
wasn't totally satisfied with this so I kept digging, as you'll see in this
post.

Is this the definition first world problem? Sure is. But on the other hand I
paid for the whole monitor and GPU, so
[I'm gonna use the whole monitor and GPU](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/search/?q=i%20paid%20for%20the&restrict_sr=1)!

## The Clue

When AMD released the 21.7.1 drivers I decided to see if the 144Hz crashing issue
was fixed. Spoiler alert: it's not fixed, at least not for all of us. During
my latest test I noticed that my VRAM was constantly locked at 1750Mz when I
set my refresh rate to 144Hz. This is fine when gaming, but why would it be
locked so high when the PC is idle? As soon as I changed my refresh rate back
to 120Hz the VRAM was able to fluctuate between 200Mhz and 1750Mhz, depending
on workload. Why is it fine at 1750Mhz gaming at 120Hz, but not fine at 1750Mhz
when gaming at 144Hz? I still don't know, but I knew that I had found a lead.

Using the VRAM clock speed clue leads us to a fantastic solution by
[Hard Reset on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td3mBgE1Dsc). Their
video demonstrates that creating a Custom Resolution solution solves the issue.
I created a 1440p custom resolution with a 142Hz refresh rate, and my crashing
problems were solved. So, is this it? Case closed? Not entirely!

Image quality seemed different when using my new custom resolution. It wasn't very
noticeable, but what has been seen cannot be unseen. Every time I opened a new
tab in my web browser I could see a grain on the blank page if I looked closely.
I think this was because the custom resolution was limiting colour depth.
Radeon Software liste 8 and 10 bit colour options, but selecting either would
fail and revert back to 6 bpc after using the technique from that YouTube
video.

![Radeon Software Limited to 6 bpc](/res/img/posts/2021-07-26-amd-driver-memory-lock-timeout/radeon-6bpc.png)

## ~~The~~ My Solution

I'm not a video expert, but I assume the custom resolution configuration was
maxing out the available bandwidth on my DisplayPort. Now, I know for a fact
that I can run at 1440p 144Hz with 10 bit colour via DisplayPort on my hardware
since the default resolutions support this, albeit with an occasional driver
crash when gaming. Knowing this, I spent a few minutes tweaking the custom
resolution settings in Radeon Software to try get it to expand the colour
depth while retaining a high-refresh rate. After 5 minutes I accepted
defeat ðŸ˜¢

This is when I turned to [CRU (Custom Resolution Utility)](https://www.techspot.com/downloads/7345-custom-resolution-utility.html).
It was mentioned in one of the threads I found online when researching this
issue, so I figured it was worth a try.

Here's how I used CRU to create a high-refresh rate that supported the full
colour depth of my monitor:

*Edit: This solution is for 10 bpc. Use the one from the top of the article if 144Hz is more important to you than having 10 bpc.*

1. Start the CRU program.
1. Take note of the **Pixel Clock** listed beside the default entry for 144Hz (or whatever resolution/refresh rate combination is causing trouble for you).
1. Add a new entry under the **Detailed Resolutions**.
1. Double click this new entry to open the Edit dialog.
1. Select *Automatic (PC)* from the **Timing** dropdown.
1. Set the **Refresh Rate** to a value that results in a **Pixel Clock** that's equal to, or less than, the default value.
1. Click the OK button to save the custom resolution.

At this point you will have two resolutions listed like so. The **Pixel Clock**
of the new resolution does not have to match the original perfectly, just be
sure it's **equal or lower**.

![CRU Listing](/res/img/posts/2021-07-26-amd-driver-memory-lock-timeout/cru-list.png)

I managed to get them to align at 568.72Mhz while keeping a 136Hz refresh rate
somehow by setting the timing back to **Manual** and editing the
**Pixel Clock**, but can't get it to happen when I try again when testing it
for this blog! I'm too lazy to spend more time trying to squeeze the refresh
rate higher, and the difference between 144Hz and 136Hz is less than half a
millisecond so who cares. Wait, couldn't you make a similar argument for 120Hz
vs 136Hz and that I shouldn't have wasted my time on this first world problem? ðŸ¤”

No, this effort is for "science"! Anyways, click the "OK" button to close CRU.
Run the **restart64** executable included with your CRU download. Your screen
will go blank for a moment, then come back to life. Now, head over to the
Windows display settings.

![Windows display settings](/res/img/posts/2021-07-26-amd-driver-memory-lock-timeout/display-settings.png)

Verify that the selected resolution matches that one you created in CRU, then sroll down and select
**Advanced display settings**.

![Windows display settings before](/res/img/posts/2021-07-26-amd-driver-memory-lock-timeout/advanced-display-settings-before.png)

Take note of the listed **Bit depth**, e.g 10-bit in my case. Select your
custom refresh rate. The screen will go blank briefly, and should return
to normal after a second. If everything seems fine click the
**Keep changes** button. If the screen remains blank don't panic! It just
means your custom refresh and resolution isn't supported, but Windows will
revert the change after 30 seconds.

If you were able to select **Keep changes**, verify that the listed
**Bit depth** matches what it was previously. You should also verify that your
monitor is displaying the refresh rate correctly. Many monitors include an
overlay that displays the active refresh rate. For example, my monitor has it
built into the settings overlay [like this](https://www.tftcentral.co.uk/images/lg_27gl850/P1210225.JPG).
This verification is important, since I found that Windows might accept the
custom resolution and refresh rate, but in reality your monitor will only
output half of the refresh rate. For example, I had a 140Hz refresh rate
configured, but my monitor was only displaying at 70Hz which was pretty
noticeably slower than 140Hz, and also easily confirmed via the monitor
settings!

You can see that my custom refresh rate of 136Hz retains 10 bit depth. It
might be possible to push the refresh rate higher and maintain the 10 bits, but
I've been unable to find a setting that does so with my monitor and GPU. A few
tutorials state that increasing the blanking on the default resolution profile
does the trick too, so it might be worth trying.
