On a recent customer engagement myself and Red Hat Mobile consultants needed to
write a logging solution that could be used across a number of Node.js
microservices. It had to use a standard logging module, but provide sensible
defaults too depending on what environment our Node.js code was running in. We
created [fh-bunyan](https://github.com/evanshortiss/fh-bunyan) to address this
need.

_fh-bunyan_ exposes an interface that returns standard _bunyan_ logger
instances, but it will configure them using sensible defaults depending on the
environment your application is running in. Environment in this instance refers
to the value of _process.env.FH_ENV_. Here are the default levels:

* dev - trace
* test - debug
* preprod - info
* prod - info

These can even be reconfigured by using the _setLogMappings(map)_ function too,
so if you don't like the defaults then that's fine! You could do the following
to configure them to your liking:

{% highlight javascript %}
var bunyan = require('fh-bunyan');

bunyan.setLogMappings({
  dev: 'trace',
  test: 'info',
  preprod: 'info',
  prod: 'warn'
});

var log = bunyan.getLogger(__filename);

log.debug('debug level - only appears in dev due to our mappings!');
log.info('info level - appears in dev, test, preprod, and prod!');
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can write more code, and worry less about choosing a log library and
configuring it across all of your Red Hat Mobile MBaaS environments!
