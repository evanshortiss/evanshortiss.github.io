## node modules
The node.js community loves its modules. So much in fact, that over TODO have
been published as of writing. Sure, some of those are placeholders, or
complete fluff, and some are [even controversial](), but overall node modules, and
the supporting npm ecosystem are great!

If you've been using node.js for a while, chances are you have a good idea
or set of operations you need to perform frequently enough that you'd like to
version, or just avoid copy and pasting around (not a good idea folks).
